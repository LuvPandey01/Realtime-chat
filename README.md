## Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository


To get started with the Realtime Chat App, first clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/LuvPandey01/Realtime-chat.git`. After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder with `cd Realtime-chat`. Once inside the project, install the necessary frontend dependencies by running `npm install`. This will install React and Socket.io-client, which are required for the frontend. After the installation, you can start the React development server using the `npm start` command. If you're also working on the backend, navigate to the backend folder using `cd backend` (if your backend is in a separate folder). Install the backend dependencies, which include Express and Socket.io, by running `npm install express socket.io`. After that, you can start the backend server using `node server.js`. Additionally, if you're using ESLint for linting during development, you can install it by running `npm install eslint --save-dev`. Following these steps will set up both the frontend and backend, allowing you to run the real-time chat application locally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LuvPandey01/Realtime-chat.git
cd Realtime-chat
